"""Real-browser harness for the web app — the other platform with no coverage.

Every route is captured at BOTH 375px and 1440px. The project's density rule is
"test at 375px before 1440px", and a desktop-only sweep cannot see the failure
that rule exists to prevent: a layout that is fine wide and clipped narrow. The
clip detector reads the narrow frame, which is where clipping actually happens.
