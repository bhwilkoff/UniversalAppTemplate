"""Ship the Apple apps to the App Store end to end — no App Store Connect UI.

    python3 tools/asc_release.py status
    python3 tools/asc_release.py ship --notes-file whats-new.txt --submit
    python3 tools/asc_release.py ship --platform ios --dry-run

The full ship is CLI: nobody opens App Store Connect to press Submit. Every trap
below built and archived GREEN in a shipped app and failed only at submit — read
them before changing anything here.

WHAT THE UPLOAD DOES NOT DO
  `appstore-build.yml` uploads a binary. A TestFlight build is NOT an App Store
  version — they are separate records, and the absence of the second is why
  submitting "the uploaded build" does nothing. `ship` opens the version.

THE OBVIOUS SUBMIT ENDPOINT IS A TRAP
  POST /v1/appStoreVersionSubmissions answers
      403 The resource 'appStoreVersionSubmissions' does not allow 'CREATE'.
          Allowed operation is: DELETE
  Deprecated, not broken, and the message never says so. Submitting is three
  calls: create a `reviewSubmissions`, add the version as a
  `reviewSubmissionItems`, then PATCH `submitted: true`. Apple's model is a
  submission CARRYING items, which is why a version cannot be sent alone.

THREE PLATFORMS MEANS THREE SUBMISSIONS
  tvOS, iOS and macOS ship from one universal target with ONE build number, but
  Connect keeps a separate appStoreVersion AND a separate reviewSubmission per
  platform. Hardcoding one platform (filter[platform]=IOS) silently ships one
  app. Default here is every platform in APP_STORE_PLATFORMS (all three unless
  the app skipped one).

BUILDS MUST BE FILTERED BY PLATFORM
  `platform=all` produces three builds sharing one number. Without
  filter[preReleaseVersion.platform] the first match wins at random and Connect
  rejects it with "The specified build has a different platform than the
  version" — which reads like a build problem rather than a query problem.

A WRONG VERSION STRING CANNOT BE DELETED — ONLY RENAMED
  Connect ACCEPTS a versionString lower than the live one (creation does not
  enforce ordering — the rejection comes later, at review), and DELETE answers
      409 STATE_ERROR  Only the first version of any platform can be deleted.
  So a mistyped version is permanent as a record. It IS renameable while in
  PREPARE_FOR_SUBMISSION, which is the recovery: PATCH versionString rather
  than trying to remove it. That is also why `ship` RECONCILES an existing
  editable version's string to the target instead of leaving it alone.

THE VERSION STRING COMES FROM AppVersion.xcconfig
  So the App Store version always equals the binary's own
  CFBundleShortVersionString and the two numbering schemes cannot drift apart.

NO SUBMISSION WITHOUT WHAT'S NEW
  Apple refuses review without whatsNew — AFTER the version is created and the
  build attached, leaving half-made versions on every platform. `ship --submit`
  refuses up front instead.

CONFIG (env wins over tools/app_config.py):
  ASC_KEY_ID, ASC_ISSUER_ID     the App Store Connect API key (the .p8 lives in
                                ~/.appstoreconnect/private_keys or ASC_KEY_PATH)
