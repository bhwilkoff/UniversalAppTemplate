"""One spelling locale in everything a person reads on a screen.

WHY THIS IS MECHANICAL. In Archive Watch the owner found "programme" on a
label and assumed there was already a rule. There was not, so the words had
been drifting for as long as anyone had been writing them. A rule written
down and checked by nobody drifts again; this check is the part that does not.

This template's locale is US English. Change BRITISH below (or invert it) if
your app's locale differs; the point is ONE locale, linted.

WHAT IT CHECKS: string literals, on every platform, in the files a person's
eyes reach. Not comments and not design docs: a red suite over a comment
teaches people to ignore the suite.

WHAT IT ALLOWS: strings that match somebody else's data (search keywords that
must match either spelling), and framework identifiers. Each exception in
ALLOWED carries its reason.
