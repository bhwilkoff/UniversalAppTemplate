"""Real-hardware harness for the Windows app — the sixth platform on the bench.

Same contract as atv_run / ios_run / adb_run / mac_run: drive the app to a known
surface with an env hook, photograph the glass, OCR it, and grade. Nothing is
believed because the app said so.

Windows-specific realities, learned the same way the others were:

  * The app is SELF-CONTAINED (PublishSingleFile), so the box needs no .NET SDK.
    Publishing happens on the Mac and the output is copied over — the Windows
    machine is a device, not a build server.
  * The capture is the whole desktop. A window-region grab on macOS kept
    photographing whatever was in front of the app, and there is no reason to
    expect Windows to be kinder.
  * A dark or blank frame is reported as a MEASUREMENT (percent black, mean
    luma), never as "the screen was off" — that phrasing cost a lot of wrong
    conclusions on the iPhone.
