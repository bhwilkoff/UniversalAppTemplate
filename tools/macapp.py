"""Drive the Mac app by PROCESS, never by name.

`tell application "AppName" to activate` looks harmless and is not. The
harnesses exec the app binary directly (that is the only way APP_* env hooks
reach a GUI app), so the running instance is not a LaunchServices-registered
application. AppleScript therefore resolves the NAME instead, which either

  * launches /Applications/AppName.app alongside the build under test —
    two processes with one name, and screenshots of whichever won the race, or
  * hangs indefinitely waiting for a launch that never completes, which killed
    an entire 18-cell lap when the timeout propagated.

Both were observed. Every call here targets a specific unix pid, so the app under
test is the app measured, and a name collision cannot occur.
