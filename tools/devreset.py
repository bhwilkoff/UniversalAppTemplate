"""Return every device to a known, empty state — and SAY what it is about to test.

Two problems, one cause. Nothing in this harness ever put a device BACK: a run
left the app wherever it finished — mid-round, still in a room, hosting a night —
and the next run launched on top of that. So a test could inherit the previous
test's screen, and looking at a device on the desk told you nothing about what was
being tested on it.

    reset("pixel")                     # stop the app, leave the device idle
    reset_all(["ipad", "pixel"])       # in parallel where the tool allows
    label("pixel", "daily · empty state")   # what this device is for, on its screen

`label` sets APP_QA_LABEL, which every client renders as a small banner. It is
inert when unset, so it costs a shipped build nothing — and it means a photograph
of the bench is self-describing, instead of six screens that all look like the app.
