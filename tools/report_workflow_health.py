report_workflow_health.py — carry the auditor's findings to a GitHub issue.

An auditor never fails. A workflow going red says "I could not do my job",
and the auditor did its job the moment it looked. Failing it to signal
somebody ELSE's problem is a category error, and an alert channel that cries
wolf is one the owner mutes — after which a real break goes unread. The owner
has corrected this twice:

    "I shouldn't receive a failure alert for a non-failure status."

So urgent findings go to ONE issue, by title:

  * nothing urgent  -> any open issue is closed with a note
  * something urgent -> the issue is opened, or its body UPDATED in place

Updating rather than commenting is deliberate: the question a reader has is
"what is wrong NOW", not "what has ever been wrong". The issue body always
holds the current state, and its existence is the alert.

Run (from the audit step, which writes its findings to the step summary):
  python3 tools/report_workflow_health.py --summary "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY"
