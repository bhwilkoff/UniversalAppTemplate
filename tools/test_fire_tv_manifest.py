test_fire_tv_manifest.py — locks the Fire TV manifest gate.

Every case is drawn from the real aapt2 badging of the two APKs in the
incident the gate exists for: an old build (minSdk 29), which the Amazon
Appstore hid from every Fire OS 7 device while users reported
"incompatible", and the fix (minSdk 23) that had been built five weeks
earlier and never uploaded. The first case is the NEGATIVE CONTROL — the good binary must
still pass, or a gate that rejects everything would look like a working one.
