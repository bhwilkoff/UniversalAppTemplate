audit_fire_tv_manifest.py — the Fire TV APK reaches Fire OS 7, or it does not
ship.

THE INCIDENT THIS EXISTS FOR. Users of a shipped app reported it as
"incompatible" on Fire TV Sticks and Cubes. Nothing was wrong with the app: the
LIVE Amazon binary was an older build declaring **minSdkVersion 29**. Fire OS 7
is Android 9 — **API 28** — so every Fire OS 7 device was filtered out by the
store before a download could start. Amazon's own Target-your-app page said so
in one line nobody was reading: **Fire TV (98) — 38 selected**.

The fix (minSdk 23) had been built five weeks earlier and was never uploaded.
A fix that is not published is not a fix, and the store's device count is the
only place that difference is visible.

WHAT IS CHECKED, and why each one filters a device out of the Appstore:
  * minSdk <= 28              — anything higher loses the whole Fire OS 7
                                generation (Sticks, Cubes, most TV Editions).
  * every <uses-feature> optional — a required feature a TV lacks (touchscreen
                                above all) removes the TV form factor entirely.
  * armeabi-v7a AND arm64-v8a — Fire TV ships both 32- and 64-bit userspaces.
  * a leanback launcher activity — without one the app cannot appear on a TV.
  * not built against a PREVIEW platform — a canary compileSdk is a shape no
                                store guarantees to accept.

WHERE IT RUNS: call it from the Amazon upload step before an upload can
happen, so a binary that would repeat the incident cannot be sent at all.
Run it by hand against any APK:

    python3 tools/audit_fire_tv_manifest.py path/to/app-amazon-release.apk

Exits non-zero on any finding. If the Android SDK's aapt2 cannot be found it
FAILS rather than passing — a check that cannot read must never look like a
check that passed (an instrument says when it is blind).
