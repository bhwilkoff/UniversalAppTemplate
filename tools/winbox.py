"""Drive a real Windows 10/11 machine over SSH — the sixth device in the fleet.

Decision 045 said there is no Windows box, so `windows-latest` IS the box and
everything is observed through CI artifacts. That constraint is now lifted for
ITERATION: a real machine on the LAN can be deployed to, launched, and
photographed in the same loop as the Apple TV or the Pixel. CI stays the GATE —
"it works on the machine in the den" is not "it works on a clean runner" — but
the edit/see cycle no longer costs a push and a four-minute workflow.

The transport is OpenSSH with PUBLIC-KEY auth, deliberately:
  * it is the only Windows remote channel that gives a shell, file copy and
    PowerShell in one thing, from macOS, without extra software;
  * key auth means no password is ever typed, stored, or seen by this tooling.

Everything here mirrors the shape of macapp.py / adb_run.py so the harnesses
stay legible side by side: connect, deploy, launch, capture, quit.

    python3 tools/winbox.py --check          # is the box reachable?
    python3 tools/winbox.py --deploy         # publish + copy the app over
    python3 tools/winbox.py --shot out.png   # launch and photograph it
