"""
AppVersion.xcconfig is the ONE version number — including on Android.

In a shipped app the Android build carried `versionName = "1.42.6"` under a
comment saying it "tracks the Apple apps (AppVersion.xcconfig)". Nothing read
that file, so the literal drifted 88 patch versions behind: for weeks an
Android user reporting a problem named a version family that no longer
existed, and a crash cluster could not be matched to the code that produced it.

The build now READS the file, which makes drift impossible by construction.
This guards the construction — someone typing a literal back in is exactly how
it happened the first time. (versionCode stays a literal: Play owns its
monotonic sequence, and play-release.yml bumps it.)

Run: python3 tools/test_version_contract.py   (exit 0 = pass; a repo with no
android/ module passes with a note)
