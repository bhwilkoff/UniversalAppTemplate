"""Real-hardware harness for the macOS app — the 5th platform, and the one with
no coverage at all until now.

The Mac is the only platform where the app is not alone on the display, so the
capture crops to the app's own window via System Events bounds. A full-screen
grab reads the desktop, the menu bar and whatever else is open, and every one of
those strings would count as "text the app put on the glass".
