"""Shared spine for the real-hardware harnesses (tvOS / iOS / Android).

Archive Watch runs three hand-written harnesses that share nothing but an OCR
binary, and it pays for that: its iOS harness has no wake, no alive probe and no
retry ladder because the tvOS resilience was never back-ported. Everything here
is the part that is genuinely platform-agnostic — OCR, grading, artifact paths,
and the blind-instrument guard — so a lesson learned on one device reaches all
of them.

Device plumbing deliberately does NOT live here. Waking a tvOS box over
Companion, unlocking a Pixel over adb, and giving up on a locked iPad are not
the same operation wearing different hats, and pretending otherwise is how you
get a lowest-common-denominator harness that cannot express what any one
platform actually needs.
