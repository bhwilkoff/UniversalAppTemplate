# Provenance

Every lesson in this template was paid for in a real app. This page
records which app, where the lesson lives here now, and what was left
behind on purpose, so the next audit knows what "complete" means and
nobody rediscovers an exclusion.

**Audits.**

- **2026-08-24**, the Universal generation: Archive Watch (decisions
  through 095), Tidbits Trivia (56), Quint (27), BOBA Playbook (frozen
  2026-06-30), Bsky Dreams (through 2026-08-24).
- **2026-08-26**, BOBA re-audit: the earlier assumption that BOBA's late
  cycle was already folded in was wrong. Nine skills, the TRADE-DESIGN
  template and Decisions 044 to 052 came out of it.
- **2026-09-30**, Archive Watch decisions 096 to 158, plus everything
  since the September 1 to 9 ports: the real-device harness, Pulse,
  store tooling, floors by hardware, parity practice, and the data
  contract. The full work queue is
  `docs/maintaining/ARCHIVE-WATCH-GAP-AUDIT-2026-09-30.md`, and the
  record of the reorganization it drove is
  `docs/maintaining/RESTRUCTURE-PLAN.md`.

## Deliberate exclusions (do not "rediscover" these)

- **Archive Watch's Watch Together Studio and Creation Studio engines**
  (live broadcast, camera compositing, clip editing): app-specific. The
  generic halves (own a small documented protocol, prove it against a
  local server with a wrong-key control) are noted in
  `docs/ENGINEERING-PROCESS.md`.
- **Archive Watch's rights-audit specifics and its catalog, subtitle and
  poster pipelines** (about forty workflows): inseparable from
  archive.org. The patterns are in `docs/CI-FLEET.md` and the data-plane
  skill.
- **A social posting pipeline and the `social-video-teaser-craft` skill**:
  not ported yet. A candidate for a later audit.
- **Archive Watch's catalog pipeline** (~150 tools: discovery, enrichment,
  rights audit, TV spines, covers, subtitles sourcing): inseparable from
  archive.org and that app's data model. The PATTERNS it proved are here
  (CI-FLEET, marker rules, additive merges); the tools are not. Worked
  examples: Archive-Watch `tools/` + `docs/decisions/`.
- **`macos-creation-studio-engine` skill**: a Mac video-editor engine for
  one app. Its two reusable AVFoundation truths (one-model-to-composition;
  the two-pass grade→overlay rule) are noted in the MACOS-DESIGN template
  lineage; build the rest per app from `docs/research/`
  video-clipping material in Archive Watch if ever needed.
- **Tidbits' game/corpus/multiplayer internals**: the generic halves
  already live in `cross-platform-multiplayer` / `-determinism` /
  `content-corpus-derivation` (Quint era).
- **App-specific binding design docs** (tvOS-DESIGN etc. of each app):
  the template ships SEEDS in `docs/templates/`; the filled-in docs stay
  with their apps.
- **Duplicate framework skills.** On 2026-09-30, twelve legacy copies that
  matched their newer twins were deleted. `ios-security` and
  `metrickit-diagnostics` remain because their content differs (see
  `.claude/skills/README.md`).
- **BOBA's uncommitted skill dump + stray store artifacts**: superseded
  as artifacts. (The 2026-08-24 claim that BOBA's committed lessons were
  "already folded in" was wrong, and was corrected by the 2026-08-26 re-audit
  above. What remains deliberately excluded: BOBA's card-catalog
  pipeline itself, the Radish-specific tooling, the practice-battle
  engine, and its filled-in binding design docs, which are app-specific; their
  generic halves now live in the skills listed above.)

## The upstreaming rule

When a session in any app repo produces a template-worthy lesson: (1) fix
it in the app, (2) upstream the GENERIC form here in the same working
session (a doc section, a skill trigger, a tool, or a seed Decision), and
(3) add or update the row above. Lessons trapped in app-local docs are the
drift this file exists to catch: Tidbits wrote 20 docs and zero skills in
its biggest month, and that gap took an audit to find.
