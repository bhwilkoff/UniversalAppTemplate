# Windows Tidbits — Build/Test/Ship Playbook ($0, from a Mac)

**Companion to `WINDOWS-DESIGN.md`** (the binding spec) and
`WINDOWS-RESEARCH.md` (the evidence). This is the **HOW**: the exact
$0 toolchain, the observability harness that lets us SEE the Windows
UI from this Mac, the first-class-Windows implementation recipes, and
the CI/distribution pipeline. All commands run on this Apple Silicon
Mac unless marked _(CI)_.

---

## 1. Toolchain (all free, all on the Mac)

```bash
brew install --cask dotnet-sdk        # .NET 9 SDK (free); `dotnet --version`
dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates # Avalonia project templates
```
- **Avalonia 12** (pin an exact patch — §7 of the design doc: Mica is a
  moving target). **FluentAvalonia** for WinUI-accurate controls.
- Editor: VS Code + the C# Dev Kit (free), or Rider (JetBrains, paid —
  optional).
- **No Windows machine, no Visual Studio, no Xcode-equivalent needed to
  build.** The Skia renderer is why (design §0).

### Cross-build a runnable Windows binary (from the Mac)
```bash
dotnet publish src/Tidbits.Windows/Tidbits.Windows.csproj \
  -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained \
  -p:PublishSingleFile=true            # JIT, NOT AOT (§0.3)
# → bin/Release/net9.0/win-x64/publish/Tidbits.exe  (won't run on the Mac;
#   validate via headless PNG + windows-latest CI, §3–§4)
```

### Repo layout (sibling to `android/`, mirrors the universal-target idea)
```
windows/
├── Tidbits.sln
├── src/
│   ├── Tidbits.Core/         # C# port: models, RTDB client, wire types,
│   │                         #   game/queue/scoring/Elo, Live host session.
│   │                         #   OS-agnostic — NO Avalonia, NO Win32.
│   ├── Tidbits.App/          # Avalonia UI: shell, consumer game, cockpit,
│   │                         #   projector, records, settings (XAML + VMs)
│   └── Tidbits.Windows/      # net9.0-windows head: Win32HostInterop,
│                             #   packaging, entry point
└── tests/
    └── Tidbits.HeadlessTests/ # [AvaloniaFact] PNG-capture + golden-vector
```

---

## 2. The Core C# port (the ~60–70%)

Port, don't bridge (design §0.1). Source of truth = `DATA-CONTRACT.md`
+ the RTDB room schema + the existing Swift/Kotlin/JS twins.

- **RTDB client:** a C# twin of `firebase.js` / Swift `FirebaseRTDB` —
  REST over `HttpClient` (anon auth token refresh, `.json?auth=`, ETag,
  `PUT`/`PATCH`/streaming via SSE `EventSource` equivalent). No Firebase
  SDK (parity with the no-SDK Apple client).
- **Wire types:** `record` types with `System.Text.Json`; **golden-vector
  tests** (mirror `run_golden.sh`) assert byte-compatibility with the
  other clients (design §8.7).
- **Game/scoring/Elo/queue + Live host session:** direct port of the
  shared logic; unit-tested headless (no UI).
- **Persistence:** SQLite (`sqlite-net-pcl` or EF Core) for records/
  streaks/missed-facts — the SwiftData/Room analog.

---

## 3. Observability — SEE the Windows UI from the Mac (the unlock)

This is the spine that the macOS work lacked. `Avalonia.Headless`
renders the **real** UI to a PNG on the Mac, pixel-faithful to Windows
(Skia is OS-independent; only native window chrome differs).

```csharp
// tests/Tidbits.HeadlessTests/Snapshots.cs
using Avalonia; using Avalonia.Headless;
// one-time per project:
[assembly: AvaloniaTestApplication(typeof(TestAppBuilder))]
public class TestAppBuilder {
    public static AppBuilder BuildAvaloniaApp() =>
        AppBuilder.Configure<Tidbits.App.App>()
            .UseSkia()
            .UseHeadless(new AvaloniaHeadlessPlatformOptions {
                UseHeadlessDrawing = false   // false => REAL Skia pixels (load-bearing)
            });
}

public class Snapshots {
    [AvaloniaTheory]
    [InlineData("cockpit", 1280, 800, "Dark")]
    [InlineData("projector", 1920, 1080, "Dark")]
    [InlineData("consumer-game", 1100, 760, "Light")]
    public void Capture(string screen, int w, int h, string theme) {
        var win = new Window { Width = w, Height = h,
            RequestedThemeVariant = theme == "Dark" ? ThemeVariant.Dark : ThemeVariant.Light,
            Content = ScreenFactory.Make(screen) };   // env-hook style, like APP_START_*
        win.Show();
        win.CaptureRenderedFrame().Save($"artifacts/{screen}-{theme}.png");
    }
}
```
```bash
dotnet test tests/Tidbits.HeadlessTests   # writes artifacts/*.png on the Mac
# then Read the PNGs to verify design — the loop the macOS ImageRenderer couldn't do
```
- **Doubles as visual-regression:** commit baseline PNGs; diff new
  captures with a tolerance to catch layout drift.
- **What it does NOT show:** native Win11 title bar, Mica, OS font
  substitution, snap flyout — those need real Windows (§4).

---

## 4. Real-Windows confirmation (free CI) _(CI)_ — **the Windows box**

`windows-latest` is **unlimited-free on our public repo**, and per **Decision
045 it IS the Windows machine** — there is no free Windows VM to find, and
RDP-into-a-runner is ToS-gray, 6h-capped, and not sustainable. Don't re-litigate;
read the decision.

### 4.1 The CLI loop (no local toolchain needed)

```bash
# Run anything on real Windows and get the PNGs back
gh workflow run windows-repl.yml -f test_filter='FullyQualifiedName~InputDrivenTest'
gh run watch $(gh run list -w 'Windows REPL' -L1 --json databaseId -q '.[0].databaseId')
gh run download <run-id> -n windows-repl-artifacts   # then `Read` the PNGs

gh workflow run windows-repl.yml -f run_app=true             # launch the real .exe
gh workflow run windows-repl.yml -f update_baselines=true    # refresh baselines
gh workflow run windows-repl.yml -f command='dotnet --info'  # ad-hoc pwsh
```

Round trip ~2-4 min. **A green run here outranks a green run on the Mac.**

### 4.2 Three things the harness now does that it didn't

1. **Input simulation** (`InputDrivenTest`) — real clicks and typing through
   Avalonia's headless input stack, so the wiring BETWEEN a widget and the engine
   is covered, not just the render. Deterministic frame timing via
   `AvaloniaHeadlessPlatform.ForceRenderTimerTick()`.
2. **A visual-regression gate** (`VisualBaseline`) — baselines captured ON
   Windows and enforced only there. Baseline-gated renders **must be
   deterministic**: use `StartCustom` with fixed questions, never
   `engine.Start()` (it draws from the 131k corpus and differs every run).
3. **Structure Windows-only work as pure behaviour + a thin platform edge** —
   `Win32HostInterop.RoundIndicator`, `VideoFrameSink` (takes a raw BGRA pointer,
   knows nothing about LibVLC). This is what made 0.2 and 3.34 testable without a
   Windows box.

> **Pixel-format trap (cost real time once):** `Bitmap.CopyPixels` returns each
> bitmap's NATIVE format — a **captured frame is RGBA**, a **PNG-decoded file is
> BGRA**. Comparing them directly reads R against B and reports identical images
> as differing *only where they're coloured* (grey has R==G==B and agrees). Always
> normalize through one decode path. Test on COLOURED pixels; grey passes either way.

Two captures: headless PNG (deterministic) + a desktop screenshot (real
chrome/Mica).

```yaml
# .github/workflows/windows-build.yml
name: Windows build + snapshots
on: { workflow_dispatch: {}, push: { paths: ['windows/**'] } }
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-latest              # free on public repos
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v4
        with: { dotnet-version: '9.0.x' }
      - run: dotnet test windows/tests/Tidbits.HeadlessTests   # golden + PNG on Windows
      - run: dotnet publish windows/src/Tidbits.Windows -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained
      # optional: launch the exe + PowerShell CopyFromScreen for a real-chrome shot
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with: { name: snapshots, path: '**/artifacts/*.png' }
```
- Download the artifact → `Read` the PNGs → verify Mica/caption/snap that
  headless can't show. This is the "done" gate (design §8.6).

---

## 5. First-class-Windows recipes (the point of the platform)

All HWND interop lives in ONE Windows-guarded `Win32HostInterop` (design
§0.2). Sketches:

### 5.1 Mica + Win11 caption
```xml
<Window xmlns="https://github.com/avaloniaui"
        TransparencyLevelHint="Mica" Background="Transparent"
        ExtendClientAreaToDecorationsHint="True">
  <!-- panels use theme-variant brushes WITH ALPHA so Mica shows through -->
</Window>
```
Fallback if the pinned build black-windows on Mica: DWM interop —
`DwmSetWindowAttribute(hwnd, DWMWA_SYSTEMBACKDROP_TYPE, DWMSBT_MAINWINDOW)`.
**VERIFY on CI screenshot before committing to the look** (design §8.5).

### 5.2 Projector on the second monitor (the Live core, §6.3)
```csharp
var target = Screens.All.FirstOrDefault(s => !s.IsPrimary) ?? Screens.Primary;
var big = new ProjectorWindow { SystemDecorations = SystemDecorations.None };
big.Position = target.Bounds.Position;      // THEN fullscreen (order matters)
big.WindowState = WindowState.FullScreen;
big.Show();
// hot-plug survival:
Screens.Changed += (_, _) => Reproject(big);  // re-pick screen; fall back to primary, never vanish
```

### 5.3 Taskbar progress = the round timer (§6.2)
`ITaskbarList3.SetProgressValue(hwnd, elapsed, duration)` each tick;
`SetProgressState(TBPF_NORMAL/PAUSED)` on hold. Emcee sees the timer on
a minimized cockpit.

### 5.4 Global hotkeys (§6.2)
`RegisterHotKey(hwnd, id, mods, vk)` for Reveal/Next; pump `WM_HOTKEY`
via an Avalonia `Win32` message hook. Works when the projector/another
app has focus — essential for a running show.

### 5.5 Toasts (§6.5)
`DesktopNotifications.Avalonia` — register `INotificationManager` in the
AppBuilder; `Show(new Notification { Title=..., Body=... })`. Needs
package identity (§0.4).

### 5.6 Keyboard cockpit + Alt-menus (§3.2, §6.2)
Access keys via `_` in menu headers; `HotKeyManager.SetHotKey` /
`KeyGesture` for Space=reveal, ←/→=prev/next, digits=jump, Esc=hold.
Keep the system-accent focus ring visible.

---

## 6. Publishing — the channel decision (which store, and how)

**THE RECOMMENDATION: Microsoft Store as the primary channel, GitHub
Releases + winget as the $0 direct channel alongside it.** Rationale
below; game storefronts (Steam/itch.io) are a *later, consumer-only*
option, not the host/venue path.

### 6.1 Channel matrix (all Mac-authored; CI does the Windows steps)

| Channel | Cost | Signing / SmartScreen | Auto-update | Best for | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Microsoft Store (MSIX)** | **$0** (reg fee waived 2025) | **MS signs it → NO SmartScreen** | Store-managed | Broadest reach, trust, discoverability | **PRIMARY** |
| **GitHub Releases + Velopack** | $0 | Unsigned → SmartScreen until rep builds (or add Azure signing) | Velopack delta self-update | Direct download, fast iteration, beta channel | **SECONDARY (pair w/ Store)** |
| **winget** (`winget install`) | $0 | Points at your GitHub installer (inherits its signing) | via the referenced installer | Power users, IT, scriptable installs | **ADD — free, easy** |
| **Website direct** (tidbitstrivia.com) | $0 | Same as GitHub installer | via Velopack | Venue operators, link from web app | Yes (same artifact) |
| **Steam** (Steamworks) | **$100 one-time**, recoupable after $1k rev; **30% cut** | Steam handles it | Steam client | *Consumer game*, games audience | Later/optional, consumer-only |
| **itch.io** | $0 to publish; you set rev split | itch app handles it | itch app | *Consumer game*, indie audience | Later/optional, consumer-only |

### 6.2 Why Microsoft Store is the right primary path

- **It kills the signing problem for free.** Registration fee is waived
  (start at `storedeveloper.microsoft.com`, ID-verify), and **Microsoft
  signs the package** — users see **no SmartScreen "unknown publisher"
  warning** and you never buy or renew a cert. This is the single
  biggest reason to go Store-primary: it's the only $0 path that also
  removes the trust warning.
- **Discoverability + auto-update** are built in — a venue owner can
  search "Tidbits" in the Store, and updates flow without our infra.
- **Submission reality (2026):** the Store's MSIX submission is a
  **periodic semi-manual step** (Partner Center web upload; the VS
  "automate store submissions" feature was removed in VS 2026, and the
  programmatic submission API covers MSI/EXE better than MSIX). Fine for
  a desktop app shipping every few weeks — package MSIX on the free
  `windows-latest` runner, then upload to Partner Center. (Alternatively
  the Store accepts **unpackaged MSI/EXE** apps by pointing at a stable
  installer URL + the MSI/EXE submission API — but MSIX is what gets the
  auto-signing/no-SmartScreen benefit, so prefer MSIX for the Store.)

### 6.2b The Store path is BUILT — see `docs/WINDOWS-STORE-SUBMISSION.md`

Packaging + CLI submission now exist (2026-07-17):

```bash
gh workflow run windows-store.yml                    # package MSIX only
gh workflow run windows-store.yml -f submit=true     # + submit as a DRAFT
gh workflow run windows-store.yml -f submit=true -f commit=true   # + publish
```

The load-bearing facts, learned the expensive way:

- **`PublishSingleFile` is INCOMPATIBLE with MSIX.** `windows-store.yml`
  publishes multi-file on purpose; `windows-build.yml` keeps single-file for the
  direct-download `.exe`. **Do not unify them.**
- **Condition the LibVLC natives on the RID.** Referencing
  `VideoLAN.LibVLC.Mac` and `.Windows` unconditionally shipped the 42MB macOS
  dylib + the 99MB win-x86 tree inside the win-x64 package; with the native pdbs
  (~105MB) that was over half of a 211MB package. Trimmed at publish.
- **No signing certificate is needed** — the Store re-signs with a Microsoft cert
  after certification. The self-signed step in the workflow exists ONLY to make
  the artifact installable for sideload testing.
- **The 4th version segment must be 0** (Store-reserved), so the build number has
  nowhere to live and **every Store upload needs a MARKETING_VERSION bump**.
  `tools/stamp_msix_version.py` keeps it in lockstep with `AppVersion.xcconfig`.
- **Beta = private audience (UI) + package flights (CLI).** The TestFlight
  analogue; flights support staged rollout with halt/finalize.
- **A manual bootstrap is unavoidable**: the API cannot create the app, and it
  refuses to drive submissions until one full manual submission (incl. age
  ratings) exists.

### 6.3 Why ALSO ship GitHub Releases + winget (the $0 direct channel)

Store review adds latency and MSIX sandboxing; the direct channel gives
control + speed and reaches users who don't use the Store:
1. GitHub Actions: `dotnet publish -r win-x64 --self-contained` _(CI)_.
2. **Velopack** `vpk pack` → installer + delta updates + self-updating
   app _(CI, free Windows runner)_.
3. Publish assets to **GitHub Releases** (the update feed — $0 hosting);
   app self-updates via Velopack `UpdateManager`.
4. **winget manifest** (a YAML PR to `microsoft/winget-pkgs`, or
   `wingetcreate` — **free, no Windows PC needed**) pointing at the
   GitHub Release installer, so `winget install Tidbits.TidbitsTrivia`
   works for power users / IT / scripted venue setups.
- SmartScreen applies to this channel until reputation builds — the Store
  channel is the "no warning" path; this is the "full control" path.

### 6.4 The signing question (only relevant to the direct channel)

The Store channel needs no signing (MS does it). For the **direct**
channel, in cost order: **ship unsigned** ($0, SmartScreen tax) →
**Azure Artifact Signing ~$9.99/mo** (cloud, no token,
`azure/trusted-signing-action`, US individual qualifies; removes
SmartScreen; pipeline unchanged — just add a sign step) → **avoid**
OV/EV certs ($200–685/yr + mailed FIPS dongle, no better outcome; EV's
instant-SmartScreen pass was removed in 2024). **Never self-sign** (hard-
blocked, worse than unsigned).

### 6.5 Game storefronts (consumer mode only, later)

Tidbits is a game, so **Steam** and **itch.io** are legitimate channels
*for the consumer game* — but NOT for the host/venue app, and not needed
initially. **Steam** = $100 one-time (recoupable after $1k revenue) +
30% cut, but a huge built-in games audience + it handles
signing/updates. **itch.io** = free to publish, you set the revenue
split, indie-game audience. Consider these only if/when the consumer
game is a monetization focus; the host/venue marquee ships via Store +
direct.

### 6.6 Bottom line

- **Host/venue app (the marquee):** Microsoft Store (MSIX, $0, no
  SmartScreen) + GitHub Releases/Velopack + winget + a website download
  link. All $0.
- **Consumer game:** same Store + direct channels; optionally add
  itch.io ($0) and later Steam ($100) for the games audience.
- **Start with:** Store + GitHub Releases/Velopack in parallel from day
  one of shipping — same build artifact, two channels, $0.

## 7. Bootstrap sequence (to first running slice — host-first)

1. **Scaffold** `windows/` (solution + 4 projects §1) + the headless
   test project + the `windows-build.yml` CI. Commit; confirm CI green.
2. **Core port, thin:** wire types + RTDB read client + golden-vector
   test passing against the existing vectors (§2). This proves the
   contract twin before any UI.
3. **Projector window** (§5.2) rendering a static `LiveRoom.Pub` from a
   fixture → headless PNG at 1920×1080 → `Read`. First visual proof.
4. **Cockpit shell** (Mica, keyboard map, taskbar timer) publishing to a
   test `live/CODE` → verify a phone/web joiner sees it (real end-to-end
   parity, the macOS↔web pattern).
5. **Consumer game** (parity) — engine port + game view + records
   dashboard (§3, §4).
6. **Package** (sparse + MSIX), Velopack, first GitHub Release.
7. Each step: headless PNG + `windows-latest` CI + PARITY.md row.

**Definition of done for the platform:** a host runs a full night from a
Windows laptop with a projector on the second screen, players join from
phones, and the consumer game + records reach parity — verified by PNG +
CI, shipped via a $0 channel.

---

## 8. Cost ledger (honest)

| Item | Cost |
|---|---|
| .NET SDK, Avalonia, FluentAvalonia, Velopack | $0 (MIT/free) |
| Build from Mac + `windows-latest` CI (public repo) | $0 |
| Headless PNG observability | $0 |
| GitHub Releases (update feed) | $0 |
| Microsoft Store registration + signing | $0 (fee waived, Store signs) |
| **Ship-unsigned direct download** | **$0** (SmartScreen UX tax) |
| _Optional:_ Azure Artifact Signing (no SmartScreen, direct dl) | ~$10/mo |
| _Avoid:_ OV/EV certs (+ mailed FIPS dongle) | $200–685/yr |

**Steady-state $0 is achievable.** The only non-$0 option worth
considering later is ~$10/mo Azure signing, and only to remove the
SmartScreen prompt on direct downloads — deferrable and pipeline-
compatible.

---

## 9. Reproduction log — as-built 2026-07-05 (the scaffold actually works)

The bootstrap (playbook §7 steps 1) is DONE and verified. Exact working
sequence on this Apple Silicon Mac (.NET 10.0.203 already installed):

```bash
dotnet new install Avalonia.Templates
cd windows
dotnet new sln -n Tidbits                                   # → Tidbits.slnx (new slnx format)
dotnet new classlib -o Tidbits.Core -f net10.0
dotnet new avalonia.mvvm -o Tidbits.App                     # Avalonia 12.0.5 + CommunityToolkit.Mvvm
dotnet sln Tidbits.slnx add Tidbits.Core/*.csproj Tidbits.App/*.csproj
dotnet add Tidbits.App package FluentAvaloniaUI             # WinUI-accurate controls (v3.0.0)
dotnet add Tidbits.App reference Tidbits.Core/Tidbits.Core.csproj
dotnet new xunit -o Tidbits.HeadlessTests -f net10.0
dotnet add Tidbits.HeadlessTests package Avalonia.Headless.XUnit --version 12.0.5
dotnet add Tidbits.HeadlessTests package Avalonia.Skia --version 12.0.5
dotnet add Tidbits.HeadlessTests reference Tidbits.App/Tidbits.App.csproj
dotnet sln Tidbits.slnx add Tidbits.HeadlessTests/*.csproj

# see the UI from the Mac (writes windows/artifacts/mainwindow-*.png):
TIDBITS_ARTIFACTS=$PWD/artifacts dotnet test Tidbits.HeadlessTests
# cross-build the real Windows binary from the Mac:
dotnet publish Tidbits.App -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained -p:PublishSingleFile=true -o publish/win-x64
#   → publish/win-x64/Tidbits.App.exe = "PE32+ executable (GUI) x86-64, for MS Windows"
```

**Three version gotchas hit (all now fixed in-repo — will bite again on a
fresh clone with different package versions):**
1. **FluentAvaloniaUI 3.0.0 prefixes every control `FA`** — `FANavigationView`,
   `FANavigationViewItem`, `FANavigationViewSelectionChangedEventArgs` (v2 used
   the unprefixed names). Symptom: XAML "Unable to resolve type NavigationView".
   Find real names with `strings <pkg>/lib/*/FluentAvalonia.dll | grep FA`.
2. **`Avalonia.Headless.XUnit` 12.0.5 requires xunit v3** (`xunit.v3`
   3.2.2), but `dotnet new xunit` on .NET 10 pins **xunit v2** → `CS0433
   InlineDataAttribute exists in both`. Fix: replace `xunit` with `xunit.v3`
   in the test csproj.
3. **`AvaloniaTestApplicationAttribute` is in the `Avalonia.Headless`
   namespace**, NOT `Avalonia.Headless.XUnit`. Use
   `[assembly: Avalonia.Headless.AvaloniaTestApplication(typeof(TestAppBuilder))]`.

**Headless render config that produces real pixels** (not a blank stub):
`AppBuilder.Configure<App>().UseSkia().WithInterFont().UseHeadless(new
AvaloniaHeadlessPlatformOptions { UseHeadlessDrawing = false })`, then
`window.Show(); Dispatcher.UIThread.RunJobs(); window.CaptureRenderedFrame().Save(png)`.

**Verified this build:** the FluentAvalonia `NavigationView` shell renders
with all five surfaces (Play · Records · Create · Tidbits Live · Settings
footer), light + dark, brand accent — Read-confirmed from the PNG. CI
(`windows-build.yml`) reproduces the same on real `windows-latest`.
