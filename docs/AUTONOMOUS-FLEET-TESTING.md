# Autonomous testing across a fleet of real devices

> Ported from a shipped six-platform app. The tools referenced here are in
> `tools/`; fill in `tools/app_config.py` first.

How an agent drives six platforms — iOS, iPadOS, tvOS, macOS, Android, Windows — plus
the web, on **real hardware**, and grades what it sees rather than what the app claims.

This is the **method**, distilled from a six-platform app that runs it for real.
`docs/DEVICE-HARNESSES.md` holds the per-platform recipes; `tools/app_config.py` is the
one file a new app edits to point the rig at its own identity and bench.

---

## 0. The doctrine

**The app's claim is never evidence. The screen is.**

Every shortcut away from this produces a suite that passes while the product is broken.
A test that asserts `viewModel.state == .loaded` proves the view model; it proves
nothing about whether a human sees a question. Drive the real app on real hardware,
photograph the glass, and read the photograph.

Three corollaries, each of which cost real time to learn:

**An instrument must say when it is blind.** A check that cannot see its input must
die, not report clean. This is the single most repeated failure in this repo's history,
and it recurs in new disguises constantly — see §2, which is the longest section here
for a reason.

**A green build tells you almost nothing.** Every one of the four App Store blockers in
`docs/APPLE-SUBMISSION-CLI.md` compiled, archived, and signed green. They failed at
upload. The same is true of UI: the tvOS Application Support write that crashes on
device passes on the simulator.

**Drive to the degenerate outcome, not just the happy path.** The tie, the zero score,
the empty list, the cold quit, the last question. Happy-path suites miss whole bug
classes; a finished-round screen that only ever showed the last question survived a
full test suite because nothing ever finished a round.

## 1. Architecture: a shared spine, honest seams

```
tools/devharness.py     ← OCR, grading, artifact paths, the blind-instrument guard
   ├── ios_run.py       ← devicectl: install, launch with env, screenshot
   ├── atv_run.py       ← devicectl over the network + Companion wake
   ├── adb_run.py       ← adb: force-stop, am start with extras, exec-out screencap
   ├── mac_run.py       ← the app runs on this Mac; capture by WINDOW ID
   ├── win_run.py  ──┐
   │                 └── winbox.py  ← SSH to a real Windows box
   └── web_run.py   ──── webdrive.py ← Chrome DevTools Protocol, stdlib only
```

**Put in the spine only what is genuinely platform-agnostic**: OCR, text grading,
threshold logic, artifact layout, the blind-instrument guard. A lesson learned on one
device then reaches all of them.

**Keep device plumbing out of it.** Waking an Apple TV over Companion, unlocking a
Pixel over adb, and giving up on a locked iPad are not one operation wearing three
hats. Forcing them into a common abstraction produces a lowest-common-denominator
harness that cannot express what any single platform needs. The seam is honest:
*shared judgement, separate hands.*

The counter-example is instructive. A sibling project runs three hand-written harnesses
that share nothing but an OCR binary, and pays for it — its iOS harness has no wake, no
alive probe and no retry ladder, because the tvOS resilience was never back-ported.

---

## 2. The blind instrument — the failure that keeps coming back

A check that cannot see its input must **fail loudly**, never return "clean". This
sounds obvious and is violated constantly, because a broken instrument and a passing
test look identical from the outside.

Real instances from this repo, all different disguises of one bug:

| What happened | What it looked like |
|---|---|
| `xcode-select` pointed at CommandLineTools, so `xcodebuild -showBuildSettings` errored and stderr was suppressed | "`DEBUG` is defined in neither configuration" — a confident, wrong conclusion |
| `actool --stickers-icon-role app` rejected the flag outright, so the warning being grepped for never appeared | "that role accepts the icon" — a **false positive from a crashed command** |
| A single-entry asset catalog never reports "unassigned children" | "the entry was accepted" — the metric could not distinguish used from ignored |
| A test file created after `xcodegen` ran wasn't in the target | Suite passed having run **0 tests** |
| A gate grepped for its own explanatory comment | Passed on the warning about the thing it was warning about |
| OCR crop used bottom-left origin against a top-left `GetWindowRect` | Kept the wrong half of the screen, silently |

**The defenses, in order of value:**

1. **Assert the check can fail.** Ship a test that feeds the checker known-bad input
   and asserts it *rejects*. `MessagesDiagnosticTests.theScannerCanActuallyFail` exists
   for exactly this.
2. **Verify the tool works before trusting its silence.** Run a known-good control
   through it. The icon investigation only became productive after a control case
   (`iphone 60x45`, known to compile) revealed the test harness disagreed with the real
   build — the harness was missing two actool flags.
3. **Never suppress stderr on a diagnostic command.** `2>/dev/null` turned a broken
   toolchain into an empty result that read as data.
4. **Count, don't just match.** `tools/atv_see.sh` (Apple TV) refuses to return a frame whose OCR
   yields fewer than N lines — a locked or sleeping device yields zero, a real screen
   yields many. Line count is resolution-independent; byte size is not.

---

## 3. Reaching a surface: hooks are coverage

**A surface nothing can drive is untested, and it reads as a pass.**
`tools/hook_coverage.py` measures which surfaces the harness can actually reach per
platform. It went from 12 unreachable to 0 — and every one of those 12 was silently
counted as fine before it existed.

Give the app **env-gated entry points** that are no-ops in production, so any screen
can be opened directly:

| Platform | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| iOS / tvOS / macOS | `SIMCTL_CHILD_*` env, or `devicectl ... --environment-variables` |
| Android | `am start --es KEY VALUE` extras, gated on `BuildConfig.DEBUG` |
| Web | query params read at boot |
| Windows | environment variables read at startup |

Two hard-won details:

**Quote your adb extras.** An unquoted space destroyed every extra after the first, and
the resulting truncated banner was dismissed as cosmetic for hours. `tools/adb_run.py`
now routes everything through a `_q()` helper.

**Android QA hooks must be `BuildConfig.DEBUG`-gated *and you must install the debug
build*.** Against a release build the hooks silently no-op, every scenario lands on
Home, and **every scenario passes**. That is a whole suite reporting green while
testing nothing.

**Dismiss the onboarding.** A first-run modal blocks every capture, and screenshots
taken "behind" it look like the app is being driven when nothing is being driven. Ship
a `SKIP_ONBOARD` hook.

---

## 4. Grading: the wire and the glass are different witnesses

For anything networked, grade **both**:

- **The wire** — the shared backend state (here, your shared backend room). Truth,
  independent of any client.
- **The glass** — screenshots. What a human actually sees.

**When they disagree, that IS the finding.** A room that is correct on the wire and
blank on the glass is a rendering bug; correct on the glass and absent from the wire
means the client is faking it locally. Either way, one witness alone would have
reported success.

A 9-host matrix graded every platform hosting
and every other platform joining. It found **2 genuine product bugs against 11 harness
faults** — and six of those harness faults made a working app look broken. Budget for
that ratio: most of what a new fleet harness reports at first is the harness.

---

## 5. Calibrate thresholds; never copy them

A threshold ported from another project is a guess wearing a number's clothes.

A clipping threshold of `0.010` copied from a sibling app called three correctly
rendered headings clipped on every frame, because this app's gutter sits at
x = 0.0099–0.0116 on that iPad. Every threshold is calibrated **against a real capture
from the device it will judge**, and the calibration is recorded next to the constant.

---

## 6. Fleet hygiene

**Reset before each test, and say what you are testing.** Devices left in a previous
scenario's state produce results that look like bugs. `tools/devreset.py` returns each
device to a known, empty state; the harness labels the device with the scenario name so
a glance at the bench says what is under test.

**Boot exactly one simulator or emulator at a time.** Parallel boots wedge both.

**Lease devices across sessions.** Two agent sessions on one bench will fight, and the
symptom is bizarre non-reproducible failures. `tools/devlease.py` writes
`~/.device-lease/<device>.json` with owner, pid, task and TTL. The rule that makes it
safe: **never steal a live lease** — reclaim only when the owning pid is dead.

**The simulator is lenient in ways hardware is not.** tvOS permits Application Support
writes on the simulator and crashes with EPERM on device. Anything touching the
filesystem, entitlements, or sync needs a real-device check before "done."

---

## 7. Windows: the platform with no free VM

The constraint that shapes everything: **there is no free Windows VM, and the dev box
is an arm64 Mac.**

**Two complementary rigs, and both are needed:**

1. **Headless Skia** (`Avalonia.Headless` + `UseSkia()`) renders the real UI to PNG
   in-process **on the Mac**. This is what makes a $0 pipeline real, and it is why the
   framework choice was Avalonia rather than WinUI — WinUI cannot do this.
2. **`windows-latest` CI is the actual box.** "Renders on the Mac head" is never
   "correct on Windows": Mica, chrome, DPAPI, Win32 interop and LibVLC natives are
   Windows-only. Gate on CI, and refresh visual baselines *captured on Windows*.

**A real Windows machine over SSH lands in session 0.** Services session — a phantom
1024×768 desktop, `MainWindowHandle == 0`, and nothing you launch is visible on the
actual screen. Reaching the interactive desktop needs a **scheduled task with an
`Interactive` principal**. `tools/winbox.py` encapsulates this; without it you drive an
invisible desktop and photograph nothing.

**`CopyPixels` returns each bitmap's native format.** A captured frame is RGBA; a
PNG-decoded file is BGRA. Compare them without normalizing and the visual gate reports
drift that does not exist — a false failure, which trains everyone to ignore the gate.

## 8. When a surface genuinely cannot be automated

Some surfaces are closed. An iMessage extension lives inside Messages: `simctl` has no
tap primitive and XCUITest drives only your own app. The honest first response was a
script that staged a simulator and left four screenshots to a human.

That was worse than it looked. **It made the one surface with no automation also the
one surface with no observable output** — a UI regression there was invisible to
everything.

The fix generalizes: **build a harness app that hosts the real view types.** A separate
debug-only target compiles *the same view files* — not copies — and renders any screen
selected by an env var, at exact device size. That gives repeatable captures, store
screenshots, and a regression signal, all from the real UI.

What it must **not** do is fake the surrounding chrome. Compositing a fake conversation
around the views would produce a picture of an app that does not exist — fine as a
mock, unacceptable as evidence or as a store screenshot.

---

## 9. Rendering real content is a content audit

The iMessage store screenshots rendered five real questions and exposed that **four
shared one template, two word-for-word identical**. Measuring rather than reseeding
found the pack was 57.8% one question shape against 9.5% in the corpus: the selection
used `ORDER BY id LIMIT N`, and corpus ids cluster by the generator that produced them,
so it was slicing one generator's output rather than sampling.

That was a live gameplay bug — every round was mostly one puzzle — found by looking at
a screenshot.

**Look at the output.** Not the assertion about the output.

## 10. Checklist for a new app

1. `devharness.py` equivalent first — OCR, grading, artifact paths, blind-instrument
   guard. Everything else hangs off it.
2. Env-gated entry hooks on every platform, from the first screen.
3. `hook_coverage.py` equivalent, so unreachable surfaces are *visible* rather than
   silently green.
4. A lease file if more than one agent session will ever touch the bench.
5. Calibrate every threshold on a real capture from the real device.
6. Grade the wire and the glass separately for anything networked.
7. A test that proves each checker can fail.
8. Wire the store submission the same way — see `docs/APPLE-SUBMISSION-CLI.md`.
